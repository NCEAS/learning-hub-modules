As part of our comprehensive approach to open data science best practices, in addition to helping you built and practice your technical skills, we also offer non-technical lessons. These modules range from interactive activities to discussion-based lesson, mixing briefing of information with practical tips and exercises.

Most of these lessons can be delivered in person during your visit to NCEAS or remote. Some particular lessons only can be offered in-person. The modality of the lesson is stated in each lesson's description.
