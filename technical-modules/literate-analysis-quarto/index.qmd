## {{< fa scroll >}} Description
More often than not, computational analysis is written in a borderline incomprehensible way, even to the person who originally wrote the code. Quarto is a tool that allows you to combine prose with codeâ€”making it possible to do analysis and write reports all in one place. This course introduces the concept of literate analysis and explores the main functionalities of a Quarto document combining R, the programming language, and markdown, a set of text formatting directives.
