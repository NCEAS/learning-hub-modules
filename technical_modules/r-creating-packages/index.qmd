> Package your work and share it! Creating your own package allows you to organize your code and data in a way that easily be shared and reused.

## {{< fa scroll >}} Description
Most R users are familiar with loading and utilizing packages in their work but have never created a package of their own. Creating packages serves two main use cases:

- Mechanism to redistribute reusable code (even if just for yourself)
- Mechanism to reproducibly document analysis and models and their results

This lesson will walk you through a simple example of creating and documenting an R package. The goal is to demystify the complexity of this tool and encourage you and your collaborators to create a package as you see fit.
