> Handling spatial data can be tricky. The `sf` package allows for integrating R spatial software with the `tidyverse` if desired.

## Description
The `sf` package in R implements simple features, a standard that describes how spatial geometry objects in the real world can be represented in computers. This lesson will walk you through using `sf` functions to work with spatial data and create extraordinary maps.

## Prerequisites
- Intermediate R and RStudio user
- Familiarity with the packages `dyplr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot2`

## Learning Goals
- Understand how to use the `sf` package to wrangle spatial data
- Introduce static mapping with `ggplot`
- Create customized interactive maps with `leaflet`

## Duration
2 hours
