## {{< fa scroll >}} Description

In general, the data we get to work with is not in the format we need to do our analyses. The `dplyr` and `tidy` R packages provide a fairly complete and extremely powerful set of functions for us to do this reformatting quickly. This lesson aims to provide tools for reformatting data to meet your analysis needs. Learning these tools well will significantly increase your efficiency as an analyst.
