> Benefit from Git and GitHub power to facilitate collaborative research and code management practices. GitHub is design to store, track changes, and enable collaboration on computer code.


## Description
Every file in the scientific process changes. Manuscripts are edited. Figures get revised. Code gets fixed when bugs are discovered. These changes are important to track, and yet, we often use simplistic filenames to track them. Is there a better way? YES, **version control**. Version control provides an organized and transparent way to track changes in code and additional files. `Git` is a version control software and GitHub is website that allows users to store their Git repositories and share them with others. This lesson is a friendly introduction to these tools. It explains the main concepts and walks you through the `Git` and GitHub workflow using RStudio.



## Prerequisites
- Familiarity with R and RStudio
- Have a GitHub account (sign up at [github.com](github.com))
- Have `Git` installed in your computer (see instructions [here](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html))

## Learnig Goal
-   Apply the principles of `Git` to track and manage changes of a project
-   Utilize the `Git` workflow including pulling changes, staging modified files, committing changes, pulling again to incorporate remote changes, and pushing changes to a remote repository
-   Create and configure `Git` repositories using different workflows
