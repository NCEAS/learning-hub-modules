## {{< fa scroll >}} Description
Traditional ways of working with data – as files on a specific computer – limit code reproducibility to local computer environments. A typical R analysis file will load one or many data files from the local disk. However, it is rarely the case that those file paths work on your colleague's machine. Alternatively, we can access data through the Internet with a URL. But what happens if the URL to the data changes? (Which they often do). This lesson teaches you about pins and content identifiers and how to use them to access your data in a _truly_ reproducible way.
