> Apply data wrangling and data visualization methods to text and make text mining easier, more effective and consistent.

<!--Treating text as data frames of individual words allows us to manipulate, summarize, and visualize the characteristics of text easily and integrate natural language processing into effective workflows we were already using.-->

## Description
Text mining is the process by which unstructured text is transformed into a structured format to prepare it for analysis. The goal of this lesson is to introduce tools that allow us to move from unstructured text to a structured format to perform analysis.
