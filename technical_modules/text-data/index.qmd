> Apply data wrangling and data visualization methods to text, making text mining easier, more effective, and consistent.

<!--Treating text as data frames of individual words allows us to easily manipulate, summarize, and visualize text characteristics and integrate natural language processing into effective workflows we were already using.-->

## Description
Text mining is the process of transforming unstructured text into a structured format to prepare it for analysis. The goal of this lesson is to introduce tools that allow us to move from unstructured text to a structured layout to perform analysis.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of R and RStudio
- Familiarity with the packages `dyplr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot2`

## Learning Goals
- Describe what a token is and how they are used
- Demonstrate how to use stop words
- Create customized stop words
- Provide tools to give structure to unstructured text

## Duration
